# StackSample

Stack Overflow is a platform in which user post questions to a large developer community and receive answer about an issue that users have. Sometimes questions are similar and already received some answer, so knowing if the users refer to questions that already have been covered could be useful.

The aim of the project is to find similar questions on the Stack Overflow dataset retrieved from Kaggle. For the purpose of perform a similar items analysis, thus finding the similar questions that appear, I implemented in Spark the locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and approximate Near-Neighbors.
